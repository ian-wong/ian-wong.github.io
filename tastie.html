                        real
                        Design Sprint could not be simulated. Instead, each day of the sprint was extended to a weekly
                        process so the first week is mapping, sketch on the second week, decided and storyboard on the
                        third week and so on.

                        elderly patients can easily use the app to order food without needed any
                        assistance from the staff.

                        For week 2, I created a final concept sketch of the home, list of dishes and detailed dish

                        application, creating the three sketch concept helped me solidify the idea and the process of
                        the

                        helped create what screen came next after the previous action which reduced any confusion that
                        may have happened in the process. The storyboard consist of eight screen where the user would
                        begin from the login/sign up page and accomplish the task of ordering bacon and eggs from the
                        breakfast menu.

                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">In summary, based on the feedback given there were improvements that needed
                        to be done in terms of increasing the size of the font and allowing for a more detailed response
                        when personalising their dietary information. The usability and flow of the pages were
                        well-understood and had experienced the ease of navigating through the application completing
                        the two designated tasks. Considering the results of the A/B test, many users liked the current
                        colour scheme of red. From the results of the survey,all users were interested in Tastie, they
                        found value and purpose of an application like this. Majority of the users found that they were
                        in control of the application but it can be improved on.</p>

            <p class="content-text mt-3">Overall, Tastie was a fun project to complete as a UI/UX designer to improve on
                my
                design and decision skills during the development of a product. This course also helped me learn all
                about the process of design sprints and how to use it to produce fast and good products. This was my
                first experience with design sprint and I loved it. I can't wait to be able to experience the design
                sprint in a real industry project.
