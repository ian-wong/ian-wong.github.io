                        a solution to two issues. First, it aims to provide its users with a novel experience that will
                        spark an interest in cooking in the user themselves. Secondly, Foodatory reinforces core
                        concepts of food safety by providing the user with guidance should they do something 'unsafe'.

                        introduce basic cooking skills and the concept of food safety in a fun, safe and educational
                        way. These games involve some of the core physical motions used in cooking such as stirring,
                        spreading and cutting to create a gigantic pizza. The games revolve around a
                        selection of 'smart' kitchen utensils, each of which are capable of providing a variety of
                        feedback to the user in order to help them smarter and safer decisions.

                        and survive into adulthood without any culinary skills. The one major concern we had was that it
                        did not create a playful interactions rather it was a boring training mechanism which did not
                        fit the studio theme of designing playful, open-ended interactions.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        After pitching the concept to the class and we received valuable feedback that our concept
                        should focus on the novelty aspect of cooking and target a much younger audience to enhance the
                        joyful experience. From there we decided to change our concept focusing on the novelty and fun
                        aspect to the game and removed the technical aspect.

                <p class="content-text">Following on from changing the concept, the team shifted the research to
                    focus on healthy eating and cooking for children and how relying on convenient meals can have a
                    huge impact on their health. Subsequently, the team focused on the interactions at each
                    different station and how the concept can be organised together into a fun experience. Vertical
                    prototyping was used to create a basic prototype for all the interactions so that we could have
                    a sense of how the concept would be interacted. I focused
                    on the knife where I separately coded the vibration, sound, lights and touch sensor first,
                    before joining everything together. The initial prototype of the form of the knife was created
                    out of cardboard to get sense of the size and motion of cutting.

                    building of each ingredient, kitchen tool and scoping down some of the ideas due to time
                    constraints. The knife had been enlarged and made out of moldable
                    poly-doh to create it out of a stronger material. The spoon of the ladle was also created out of
                    poly-doh. Due to time constraints, a sink basin could not be created so the physical
                    construction was ruled out.

            <p class="content-text">Overall, Foodatory's final outcome was a huge success when it was presented in the
                exhibit at The Edge. We were surprised by the amount of users who enjoyed it, as both aspect of novelty
                and food safety were aimed at a much younger audience so we initially thought that it would not be as
                successful. During the exhibit, the team introduced Foodatory and explained each different station to
                create a fun, collaborative experience. To simulate the hand washing interaction, the team used a gel
                hand sanitiser instead as a sink could not be retrieved for the exhibit. Also, there was a number of
                occassions where there were issues with the capacitive touch sensor in the dough. The sensor was not
                able to detech the capacitive touch through the ladle which led to the sauce not projecting onto the
                pizza. To counteract the issue, we faked the dough technology to a certain degree, by touching the
                capacitive touch pins directly when the user spread the sauce.
