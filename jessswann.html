                        As this was a new project that a client has proposed I followed the process of Gathering
                        Requirements, Research, Sketches, Wireframe, Mockup Design, Prototype and Testing. This step by
                        step process helped me understand Jess's business and what she wanted to accomplish with this
                        website. It was also an indicator of where I was with this project in terms of the stages to
                        complete this project.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        I conducted a stakeholder interview with Jess to get an idea of everything about her business so
                        that I can figure out how I can build the website with respect and care for her business. To
                        help me understand, I asked questions around the topics:
                        <ul class="content-text">
                            <li>Why do you need this website? </li>
                            <li>Who is this targeted towards?</li>
                            <li>What are your values and the values of your business?</li>
                            <li>How are success measured for the project?</li>
                        </ul>
                        From these questions, I recognised her problem with not having that online presence besides
                        Instagram for users to be easily able find information about her. Additionally, Jess pitched her
                        ideas and discussed what needs to be completed. The main focuses of this website are to have a
                        place where she could write recipes, sell her programs, sell her merchandise, eventually be able
                        to post blogs and set up online 1-on-1 training sessions for clients.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        I started to find serveral different personal trainer websites by searching "Best Personal
                        Trainer Websites" on google. This was to get a feel of what the style, layout, colour of the
                        interface was like with PT websites which provided me with many ideas and compositions of
                        designs
                        for Jess's website. I did a competitors analysis of each website to compare the similarities and
                        differences of the information provided and how the information was portrayed. Some of my
                        inspirations for this project were:

                    <p class="content-text">
                        With the requirements and the research complete, I created quick sketches to drop down my
                        initial ideas that will be used as a base of design for the wireframes and improve upon. I
                        completed the wireframes on AdobeXD focusing on the layout and the position of the content. The
                        page that I was most concerned or needed more time to design was the home page since it was the
                        first page that the users will be presented with and the most important information had to be
                        displayed.

                        I decided to use the same light pink (#F7BDDB) from the Habit logo for the colour scheme to keep

                        presented to Jess some of the different designs that I had created and wanted her to select
                        which one was better compared to the rest.

                        After the completion of the prototype, I conducted some user testing sessions. My goals were to:
                        <ul class="content-text">
                            <li>See the steps the user takes navigating between each page.</li>
                            <li>Observe any pain points that arose for the user. </li>
                            <li>Is Jess satisfied with the current design and requirements?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">In summary, based on the feedback given there were improvements that needed
                        to be done in terms of having more emphasis on Jess's Instagram to be shown on the page. Jess
                        wanted her feed to be on the home page as she wanted more views and followers on her Instagram.
                        Another change that Jess wanted to make was to have a generic shop that not only sells online
                        programs but also products she has in mind for the future such as apparel and ebooks. She
                        decided to forego with publishing any blogs for now since she is busy with other projects so I
                        hid the blog page from the public, waiting for the time it needs to be reopened. There was no
                        pain points that the users experienced during the session and enjoyed how easy it was to find
                        the information on the page.

                Overall, this was a really fun and enjoyable first project that I completed as a freelancer after
                completing university. This was a good experience for me to learn about the whole process of
                getting real clients and solving their problems by applying what I learnt over the past years to a
                real-life situation. Some improvements that I will make in future will be handling the communication
                with the client better, I did not give weekly updates on the progress of the website and was not
                confident in asking some questions at the beginning, making me seem like I did not know what I was
                doing. I know that this is my first project with a client so I know that I can improve and fix these
                mistakes in the future. Some struggles that I had to face when I was developing in
                Wix was due to responsiveness issues where the layout and position of the
                content was different for every screen size so, to fix this I could not design outside the dotted line
                border
                within Wix.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text mt-3 pb-5">It was amazing to see that Jess loves her website and appreciative of the
                work that
                I put in. She is an amazing client to work with and an even better trainer.</p>
