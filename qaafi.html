                        was in charge creating and adapting the work. Each sprint was two weeks long where features were
                        developed frequently and in line with the clients expectations.

                        prioritised with the client to gather all the requirements correctly before starting the
                        development. Using the product backlog, specific tasks were generated for the whole team to work

                        I created wireframes during the first sprint for the initial design of the main page. The first

                        and floor is displayed specifically the staff's name,
                        facility, floor and seat is shown on the sidebar. This did not prove to be good as a lot of
                        information will be displayed when there are many staff allocated and made it difficult to see
                        the amount of seats available.

                        used category. The third wireframe showed the listed staff members with bare minimum details
                        such as there name or staff ID and when clicked upon more details of the staff will display.

                        Through iteration, this was the final design for the high fidelity prototype. You can see
                        aspects from the low fidelity prototype that was implemented and what was changed to be the end
                        result.

                Overall, the client was very impressed and happy with the work that Team Tempus had produced for the
                semester. Even though this was a high-fidelity prototype, the ability to conduct and use the features
                that was requested at the beginning of the scope created a sense of what the client could eventually use
                when fully developed. It was a fantastic opportunity to work in a project with a real client and
                experience professional work in
                an university environment. The experience that I gained helped me be more confident in communicating in
                a professional setting and managing the weekly tasks that needed to be completed for the client to see.
