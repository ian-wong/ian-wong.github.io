                        Hi! I'm Ian and I recently completed my bachelor degree of Information Technology majoring in
                        User Experience at University of Queensland on July 2019. By completing this degree, I
                        discovered the passion for interactive and product design where I can create a better
                        environment and consider the needs of the users when making design decisions. My experience
                        gained from being a front-end developer intern helped me understand how to transition prototype
                        designs to real
                        products.

                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">

                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        I have acquired and expanded my knowledge in design, prototyping, research and testing which
                        enabled me to apply these skills to all my projects and university assessment. I want to create
                        an environment where users can see the design is not only aesthetically
                        pleasing but also experience an easy and satisfying interaction throughout the whole process
                        within the product. I strongly
                        aspire to make a positive experience for all users by making sure that there is a intended
                        reason behind every design decision I make.

                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        During the time I am not working you can find me, in the gym working out and exercising as I
                        believe that being healthy is important to be able to work at my best condition without getting
                        constantly sick. I also enjoy the sense of achieving the goals that I set out where the hard
                        work that I put into training will eventually be awarded.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        Other than the gym, I also like to practice playing on my violin which helps enhances my
                        creative side beside designing. I have been playing the violin for more than 10 years but have
                        not been consistently practising since I started university however I do still enjoy playing and
                        learning new pieces.
                    </p>
