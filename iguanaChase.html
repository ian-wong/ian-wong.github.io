                    <p class="subheading">Research</p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        Before starting the design and layout of the interface, I decided to research other inventory
                        interfaces from different games to see what components are available to the user and why each
                        component is important. The games that were chosen as research were Arc, Conan Exiles and Rust
                        because of the similarities in the genre and the aspect of being able to freely explore to craft
                        and survive.
                    </p>
                    <p>The similarities between these three interfaces are that all consists areas for the inventory
                        storage, crafting menu, an image of the actual character and slots for items that the character
                        can equip. By identifying
                        some common features, it helped define what the basic functionailities of a inventory
                        interface should include and the importance of understanding how each feature fit together to
                        hep the user have an easy time managing their equipment. </p>

                    <p>To gather more research about the inventory interface in games, I conducted a user testing
                        session with participants who were young adults aged 19 - 22 who were avid gamers, familiar with
                        open world survival games like Rust. I conducted the session using a survey asking the
                        participants what are the most important features of the interface and to compare each of the
                        three interfaces above. </p>

                    <p>I interviewed around 5 people and found that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="mb-3"> A simplistic interface design like Arc's inventory was the best out of the
                            three because of
                            where each element is positioned spaciously. </li>

                        <li class="mb-3">Including the most significant character statistics is important to understand
                            the
                            character's abilities and the current level of your character.</li>

                        <li>Implementing too many statistics and features will crowd the interface making the content
                            difficult to see and comprehend.</li>

                        From the feedback gained from the user testing session, I created two different wireframes that
                        consist of the similiar elements in the interface but positioned differently. The first
                        wireframe was designed to be a small pop up inventory interface like Minecraft's interface
                        compared to the other wireframe which is a full screen interface.
                    </p>

                    <p class="content-text">
                        Aspects from the second wireframe was implemented to the mockup designs as users were happy with
                        the size of the inventory and crafting area. Through iteration, the final mockup included some
                        statistics about the character below the inventory and shows the item hotbar at the bottom to
                        easily allow users to put items to and from the inventory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text"> Additionally, creating a button to craft items made it easier for the user
                        to understand how to craft the item. I changed the colour scheme from gray as users stated that
                        it was bland and boring to have a dull background colour.</p>

                In summary, the final outcome for the team was a success in terms of designing and developing the items
                and the interaction with the player and the items. However, the inventory interface did not get
                implemented which created an unappealing design and experience from the rest of the game. I was proud of the work that I contributed to the project as a whole since working together as a team of 60 students was definitely one of the biggest challenges that I faced. Making sure that everyone understood what needs to be done each week to keep aligned with the project's requirements took a lot of meetings and stand ups but after a couple weeks, the communication between teams were brilliant.
